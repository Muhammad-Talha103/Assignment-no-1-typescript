// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.



 let Names = ["Talha","Saim","Faiz","Junaid"];

Names.forEach(Value => {
   console.log("Good Morning! "+ Value + " I hope you are Having a Great Day")
